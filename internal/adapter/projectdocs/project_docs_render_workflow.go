func renderADR() string {
	return `# Architecture Decision Records

## Purpose

Record structural choices, rejected alternatives, and decisions that affect long-term maintenance. This is not an implementation note; preserve why this structure was chosen and which alternatives should not be retried.

## When to read

- Before architecture changes, large refactors, or dependency/framework replacement
- When changing or bypassing existing structure
- When modifying code whose historical rationale is unclear

## When to append

- A new structure or boundary was chosen.
- Alternatives were considered and rejection reasons will reduce future re-analysis.
- Operations, performance, or security constraints shaped the design.

## Entry template

### YYYY-MM-DD: <decision title>

- Context: <problem and constraints>
- Decision: <chosen structure>
- Alternatives rejected:
  - <alternative>: <why rejected>
- Consequences: <tradeoffs and follow-up>
- Evidence: <files, commands, issues, docs>

func renderAgentWorkflow() string {
	return `# Agent Workflow

## Start

1. Read AGENTS.md first.
2. At session start, treat .issueops/CONSTITUTION.md as the baseline principle document.
3. If MCP is available, send the current task to project_docs_route and select only necessary docs.
4. Verify inferred doc claims against current files and command output.

## MCP usage rule

- At session start the installed SessionStart hook (issueops hook session-start) injects the project-doc catalog. It is context for judgment, not an auto-execution command.
- Use MCP when the task needs current state, repo-specific doc routing, policy decisions, state checkpoints, or durable records that the model should not rely on from memory.
- Do not use MCP for simple reasoning or summarizing already opened files.
- Avoid exposing many tools at once; narrowly use route/read/revise/append/check tools that match the task.
- Do not trust tool output blindly; check paths, exists flags, warnings, and verification evidence.

## Work

Use the Simplicity First and Surgical Changes principles from AGENTS.md, plus these project append/safety rules.

- Do not overwrite existing user changes.
- Add dependencies, deploy, or perform destructive actions only with explicit instruction or strong evidence.
- If docs diverge from current code or user consensus, use project_docs_read to verify the current SHA and project_docs_revise to change one document at a time.
- When a problem occurred and was resolved, record it with MCP project_docs_append(kind=caution) as a dated file under .issueops/cautions/.
- When a structural decision or rejected alternative matters, record it with MCP project_docs_append(kind=adr) as a dated file under .issueops/adr/.

## Verify

Use the Goal-Driven Execution principle from AGENTS.md, plus these verification routing rules.

- Before writing or modifying tests, read the good/bad test criteria in .issueops/TESTING.md.
- When changing CLI/MCP/API documentation contracts, also run golden/schema/smoke verification.
- Completion reports must include test/build/static-check results and reasons for skipped verification.

## Finish

- If a commit is needed, follow .issueops/COMMIT_POLICY.md.
- Record resolved false cases or structural decisions with MCP project_docs_append when useful.
