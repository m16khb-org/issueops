// B6 — self-consistency (Wang 2022) over N OFFLINE-recorded judge verdicts of the
// SAME artifact. This file never invokes a judge; running judgement N times in
// CI would violate the deterministic-eval non-goal. It only aggregates samples
// recorded elsewhere.
//
// HONEST SCOPE: self-consistency reduces VERDICT VARIANCE across same-model
// samples; it does NOT reduce or detect the judge's systematic BIAS — a consensus
// of a biased judge is still biased. The spread/variance figures are DESCRIPTIVE
// statistics over the supplied samples; they are valid only if the samples are
// genuinely independent draws (distinct sample ids + non-empty provenance are
// enforced below; provenance MAY be shared across distinct samples from the same
// offline source bucket) and only meaningful where verdicts actually vary (on a
// clean 100/100 run the merged verdict is bimodally pinned and its variance is
// degenerate — see A7).
