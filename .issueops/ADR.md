# Architecture Decision Records

작성일: 2026-05-25.

> 이 파일의 날짜별 항목은 append-only 결정 이력이다. 과거 항목의 retired host/schema/command 명칭은 당시 근거를 보존하는 역사 표기이며 현재 지원 계약이 아니다. 현재 운영 표면은 루트 `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`와 가장 최근의 명시적 superseding 결정이 정한다.

이 색인은 accepted architecture decision의 정규 입구다. 기존 immutable record는
`adr/decisions/`에 남고, `project_docs_append(kind=adr)`로 추가되는 새 record는
`adr/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`에 저장된다. 두 경로의 accepted decision을 본 색인으로 링크한다.

## Accepted baseline

- **아키텍처:** 외부 하네스 코어(CLI/MCP/worker)에 얇은 host adapter를 얹는
  hybrid 구조. 근거는 [plugin vs external worker](adr/decisions/2026-05-25-plugin-vs-external-worker.md)
  와 [Go 언어 선택](adr/decisions/2026-05-25-go-language-selection.md) 결정에 있다.
- **First-party hosts:** Codex, Claude Code, Omo native가 같은 shared skill,
  MCP, lifecycle activation contract를 사용한다. 근거는
  [Omo native first-party host](adr/decisions/2026-08-12-omo-native-first-party-host.md)
  결정에 있다.
- **External integrations:** native activation, readiness, self-verification은
  standalone으로 유지한다. Native activation 뒤 Claude-scoped declarative catalog를
  non-fatal로 provision할 수 있는 좁은 예외는
  [optional upstream provisioning](adr/2026-08-28-optional-upstream-provisioning-preserves-the-standalone-core.md)이 소유한다.
- **구현 로드맵:** phase별 계획, 목표 아키텍처, MVP 범위, 위험, 다음 작업 후보는
  [adr/roadmap.md](adr/roadmap.md) 가 소유한다.
- **결정 규칙:** status model, naming, authoring 규칙과 archived history
  ledger는 [adr/README.md](adr/README.md) 가 소유한다.

## Decision index

Reverse-chronological. Same-day records use a distinguishing slug. Status model
and supersession rules live in [adr/README.md](adr/README.md).
