# Operating Documentation Architecture

This directory defines how `.issueops/` operating knowledge is divided,
navigated, and validated.

## Design goals

- Keep required project-doc entrypoints stable.
- Give every rule and decision one canonical owner.
- Make targeted context retrieval possible without loading unrelated history.
- Keep indexes concise and detailed modules independently reviewable.
- Preserve all current information while moving it; do not summarize away
  operational constraints.

The measured starting point and responsibility analysis are in
[`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md). The machine-readable ownership contract is
[`manifest.json`](manifest.json).

## Navigation model

Required root documents remain at their existing paths because the runtime
project-doc contract discovers those exact filenames:

```text
.issueops/
├── ADR.md
├── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── CAUTIONS.md
├── CONVENTIONS.md
├── OPERATIONS.md
├── TESTING.md
├── adr/
├── architecture/
├── archive/
├── cautions/
├── conventions/
├── operations/guides/
├── testing/
└── documentation/
```

Each required root document is a canonical index. It owns:

1. the short normative summary needed by every agent;
2. links to responsibility-specific modules;
3. update instructions for that document family.

Detailed modules own procedures, rationale, examples, and historical records.
They link back to their family index and do not duplicate another family's
normative rules.

## Ownership map

| Topic | Canonical owner |
|---|---|
| accepted architecture decisions | `ADR.md` and `adr/decisions/` |
| dependency direction and runtime topology | `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `architecture/` |
| known risks and incident lessons | `CAUTIONS.md` and `cautions/` |
| implementation and interface conventions | `CONVENTIONS.md` and `conventions/` |
| installation and runtime operation | `OPERATIONS.md` and `operations/` |
| test strategy and verification gates | `TESTING.md` and `testing/` |
| commit formatting | `COMMIT_POLICY.md` |
| OpenAPI requirements | `OPEN_API_SPEC.md` |
| technology selection | `TECH_STACK.md` |
| agent execution sequence | `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` |
| constitutional priority and safety | `CONSTITUTION.md` |
| issueops historical audit | `archive/issueops-audit.md` |
| whole-project audit snapshot | `PROJECT_AUDIT.md` (root-retained exception) |

References outside the canonical owner carry only a link plus
workflow-specific context.

Two dated audit snapshots are records, not operating documents.
`PROJECT_AUDIT.md` stays at its root path because `quality inspect` parses it
in place (`cmd/issueops/qualitycli/quality_inspect.go`, `collectAuditItems`)
for the `audit-p0-p1-p2-items` signal and quality-catalog candidates cite it
as evidence. `archive/issueops-audit.md` is the retired IssueOps audit kept
verbatim under `archive/`.

## Size and structure budgets

- Required root index: at most 250 lines.
- Detailed module: at most 250 lines.
- One module owns one responsibility.
- One ADR file owns one accepted decision.
- One dated caution lesson file owns one incident lesson or tightly coupled
  incident set.
- A module that crosses the line budget must be split by responsibility, not by
  arbitrary part numbers.

The line budget is a retrieval boundary, not a reason to delete detail.

## Folder contracts

### `adr/`

- `README.md`: decision statuses, naming, and index
- `roadmap.md`: implementation roadmap that remains current
- `decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`: immutable accepted decision record

### `architecture/`

- `hexagonal-core.md`: domain, application, port, and adapter boundaries
- `runtime.md`: daemon, MCP, state, process, and lock topology
- `host-integration.md`: Codex and Claude thin-adapter design
- `issueops.md`: IssueOps capability verticals and ownership

### `cautions/`

- `runtime.md`: process, daemon, worker, lock, and state risks
- `security.md`: secrets, command policy, and trust boundaries
- `integrations.md`: host, hook, MCP, remote, and external-tool risks
- `audit-and-process.md`: audit interpretation and verification-process risks
- `issueops-lifecycle.md`: IssueOps state and lifecycle risks
- `issueops-orchestration.md`: IssueOps coordination and provider risks
- `issueops-execution.md`: IssueOps execution and cleanup risks
- `lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`: dated incident lesson

### `conventions/`

- `go-and-packages.md`: Go, package, contract, port, and adapter conventions
- `cli-mcp-and-output.md`: CLI/MCP schemas and response contracts
- `state-policy-and-hooks.md`: state, guards, policy, hook, and lifecycle rules

### `operations/guides/`

- `operations/guides/install-and-update.md`: installation, bootstrap, update, and rollback
- `operations/guides/cli-and-state.md`: CLI discovery and state lifecycle
- `operations/guides/skills-and-hosts.md`: native skills and host activation
- `operations/guides/troubleshooting.md`: diagnosis and recovery
- `operations/guides/issueops-providers.md`: IssueOps preparation and provider contracts
- `operations/guides/issueops-execution.md`: IssueOps execution and recovery

Existing canonical siblings under `operations/` continue to own MCP, daemon,
host, release, and installation procedures linked by `OPERATIONS.md`.

### `testing/`

- `unit-and-contract.md`: unit, integration, fixtures, goldens, and contracts
- `concurrency-and-race.md`: race, process, lock, and nondeterminism rules
- `cli-mcp-and-hosts.md`: CLI, MCP, Codex, and Claude parity
- `self-verification.md`: single-pass self-verification contract
- `api-documentation.md`: OpenAPI static and agent review gates
- `issueops-execution.md`: IssueOps and Orca execution verification

### `archive/`

Retired dated snapshots moved verbatim from living documents:

- `adr-history.md`: superseded ADR history
- `cautions-incidents.md`: superseded incident ledger
- `issueops-audit.md`: retired IssueOps audit snapshot (moved from
  `.issueops/ISSUEOPS_AUDIT.md` on 2026-08-20)

## Link rules

- Use repository-relative Markdown links.
- A root index links to every module in its family.
- Every module links back to its root index.
- Cross-family links target the canonical owner, not a duplicate summary.
- Links to source code use repository-relative paths and line-independent symbol
  names when possible.
- OpenWiki output is not edited as part of this documentation system.

## Update workflow

1. Identify the canonical owner in `manifest.json`.
2. Update one module; create a new decision or lesson record when history must
   remain immutable.
3. Update the family root index only when navigation or the universal summary
   changes.
4. Run the documentation-optimization skill validator.
5. Run `issueops docs --json` and the documented command smoke checks.
6. Review the diff for accidental duplication or information loss.

## DDD 책임 문서 분리 (2026-09-30)

[domain-responsibilities.md](../architecture/domain-responsibilities.md)는 capability별 책임을,
[issueops-cleanup.md](../architecture/issueops-cleanup.md)는 실행과 정리의 효과 순서를 소유한다.
공통 의존 방향과 사이클 권한은 기존 architecture 모듈에 유지한다.
