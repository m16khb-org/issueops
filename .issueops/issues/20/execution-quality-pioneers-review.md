# Issue #20 execution-quality pioneer review

## Scope

- IssueOps cycle: `io-4f4603393a22`
- Criterion: `issue-20-owned-skills-reviewed`
- Worker branch: `20-review-execution-quality-pioneers`
- Attempt base HEAD: `52fe8c94c2303822a3a52c3a240ccdfaf45d3fef`
- Reviewed files: `skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md`, `skills/debugging/SKILL.md`, `skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md`
- Verification mode: proportionate lightweight mode. This is a reversible documentation-only contract repair, so direct CLI output, path reads, diff inspection, and skill validators are the observable evidence surfaces.

## Binary criterion result

`issue-20-owned-skills-reviewed`: **PASS** when this report and the three reviewed skills are committed together and the four sealed verification commands below all exit 0. The final commit contains only those four worker-owned files.

## Per-skill findings

### Turing

- The active handoff record names `issue-20-owned-skills-reviewed`, while the skill hard-coded `ORCA-01` through `ORCA-14` as the current contract. The report contract now renders whichever criterion IDs the sealed worker packet supplies (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:36`).
- Proportionate mode allowed auxiliary CLI evidence for this docs-only task, but the Manual-QA section still required one of four runtime channels for every criterion. The section now scopes that mandate to full mode (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:186-188`).
- The final gate trigger now covers every goal rather than the internally inconsistent “one goal remains” state (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:415`).
- IssueOps requires reviewer claims to be verified before changes (`skills/issueops/references/review-feedback.md:28`), but Turing declared that false positives do not exist. The binding gate now requires evidence-based classification, confirmed fixes, and same-reviewer resolution (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:421-425`, `skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:503`).
- Automatic sub-agent dispatch at a five-TODO threshold conflicted with the documented net-positive-pattern gate. The relationship now keeps dispatch conditional on that gate (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:524`).
- The empty evidence-contract heading now points to the existing `skills/issueops/references/evidence-contract.md` file (`skills/verified-execution/SKILL.md:534-536`).

### Hopper

- `issueops project lint-diagnose --help`, `issueops trace analyze --help`, and `issueops self-augment lesson --help` each rendered the documented command/flag registry. Their exit 1 is the installed Go flag parser's expected `flag: help requested` result, not an unknown-command failure.
- `skills/git-operations/references/bisect-protocol.md` exists as a regular file.
- The golden diagnostic used unguarded `git checkout --`, which could overwrite pre-existing work. It now requires a clean target before regeneration and restores only the QA-generated file with an explicit `git restore --source=HEAD -- <path>` (`skills/debugging/SKILL.md:163-174`).

### Shannon

- The installed `golangci-lint run --enable dupl --max-dupl-lines 6 ./...` exited 3 with `unknown flag: --max-dupl-lines`. The command now uses the installed `--enable-only dupl` contract and leaves threshold selection to project configuration/tool defaults (`skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:166-168`).
- On this macOS host, `grep -nE '\s' skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md` matched 280 lines containing the literal letter `s`; it did not express portable whitespace. SNR and overhead patterns now use POSIX character classes, and the branch pattern uses explicit POSIX token boundaries (`skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:82-87`, `skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:133`, `skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:195`).
- Stale references to command-example line numbers were replaced with stable pattern names (`skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:137-138`).
- The quoted heredoc preserved `$(date ...)` and `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` literally while also containing invalid JSON placeholders. It is now explicitly a valid JSON schema example rather than an executable shell recipe (`skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:208-244`).
- `.issueops/evidence/code-quality-metrics/` has no matching ignore rule in the worktree `.gitignore`; the skill now requires confirming ignore policy or using issueops state/a temporary path (`skills/code-quality-metrics/SKILL.md:210-212`).

## Verification receipt

Final ordered verification run after the last content edit:

1. `git diff --check` — exit 0.
2. `python3 scripts/validate-skill.py skills/debugging` — exit 0, `Skill is valid!`.
3. `python3 scripts/validate-skill.py skills/code-quality-metrics` — exit 0, `Skill is valid!`.
4. `python3 scripts/validate-skill.py skills/verified-execution` — exit 0, `Skill is valid!`.

Additional contract checks:

- Removed-contract scan for `\s`, `\b`, `--max-dupl-lines`, `git checkout --`, hard-coded `ORCA-01`, stale reviewer absolutes, and stale example line numbers — `rg` exit 1 with no matches (expected zero-match result).
- Initial invalid Shannon linter command — exit 3, `unknown flag: --max-dupl-lines` (defect reproduction).
- `stat` of the Torvalds bisect reference and IssueOps evidence-contract reference — both regular files.

## Cleanup and skipped checks

- Cleanup receipt: no servers, tmux sessions, browser contexts, containers, ports, temporary files, or generated snapshots were created. No runtime cleanup was required.
- Skipped checks: full Go suites, browser/computer-use QA, and an adversarial sub-agent reviewer were not part of the sealed verification packet and are disproportionate for this low-risk Markdown-only repair. No API, provider, push, PR, merge, acceptance, branch deletion, or worktree deletion action was performed.
