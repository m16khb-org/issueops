# Host Operations

## Codex

Native skill examples:

```text
Use $atomic-commit-push to review my changes, split them into atomic commits, and push safely.
Use $issueops to run a problem -> issue -> plan -> TDD/subagent -> ai-slop-clean -> feedback -> PR/MR cycle.
Use $ui-ux-craft to build this interface with a coherent selection of shadcn/ui, AI UI, motion, and accent sources.
```

Install checks:

```bash
test -f ~/.codex/skills/atomic-commit-push/SKILL.md && echo ok
test -f ~/.codex/skills/issueops/SKILL.md && echo ok
test -f ~/.codex/skills/ui-ux-craft/SKILL.md && echo ok
codex mcp list
codex mcp get issueops
```

Codex system skills under `~/.codex/skills/.system` are host-managed, not
issueops managed. Verified on 2026-06-23 with `codex-cli 0.142.0`:
`$HOME/Library/pnpm/codex` is a pnpm shim to `@openai/codex@0.142.0`, that
package contains no `skill-creator` or `quick_validate.py` source files,
`~/.codex/skills/.system/.codex-system-skills.marker` contains only the system
skills payload hash, and `~/.codex/vendor_imports/skills-curated-cache.json`
does not list `skill-creator`. Do not patch `~/.codex/skills/.system` as a
durable fix; it can be re-materialized by Codex. Agent-harness skill validation
must use `python3 scripts/validate-skill.py skills/<skill-name>` so local
verification does not depend on upstream Codex system-skill changes or local
PyYAML installation.

Codex lifecycle hooks live in `~/.codex/hooks.json`. Default installation owns exactly `SessionStart`, invoking the shared context CLI with `--host codex`.

Hook behavior:

- `SessionStart` reads the static project-doc catalog and emits host-compatible context for every source, including the `compact` re-run Codex performs after compaction (verified against codex-cli 0.150.1: `post-compact.command.output` carries no `hookSpecificOutput`, so `PostCompact` is not registered). It does not read IssueOps, emit lifecycle reminders, inspect runtime state, write telemetry, maintain SQLite, recover workers, or mutate state.
- `hook post-compact` stays available for Omo (`session_compact` has no SessionStart re-run there) and for diagnosis; installer upgrade removes any managed `PostCompact` group while preserving non-harness groups.
- There is no other hook subcommand. `ISSUEOPS_DISABLE_HOOKS=1` turns the context hooks into a silent no-op.

Hook smoke:

```bash
printf '{"cwd":"%s","source":"compact"}' "$PWD" | issueops hook session-start --host codex
issueops hook post-compact --host codex --json
```

## Claude Code

Claude Code uses user skills by default:

- User: `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- Project: `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` only with explicit project-local opt-in.

Direct skill invocation example:

```text
/atomic-commit-push
/ui-ux-craft
```

MCP checks:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Inside Claude Code:

```text
/mcp
```

Default install registers user-scope MCP server `issueops`. This repo's dogfood `.mcp.json` uses `issueops_project` to avoid scope collisions.

Claude hooks live in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Default installation owns exactly `SessionStart`, calling the same context CLI/core as Codex with `--host claude`; Claude separates the readable `systemMessage` from the model-facing `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. Claude Code 2.1.247 re-runs `SessionStart` with `source:"compact"` after compaction and treats `PostCompact` stdout as a user display string only, so the catalog is re-established through `SessionStart` and `PostCompact` is not registered.

Claude project-local hooks can be committed, so do not create `.claude/settings.json` in target repos without explicit opt-in.

### Upstream plugins and skills

`configs/upstream.json` declares optional third-party plugins and Git skills
that `issueops install` (and therefore `update`) provisions for Claude Code
when missing. Codex and Omo receive only the first-party `skills/` links from
this installer path. Existing upstream entries are skipped, never reinstalled
or overwritten. The object below shows the schema; the complete catalog
currently contains four plugins and one skill.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "plugins": [{ "name": "eli5", "marketplace": "claude-community", "source": "anthropics/claude-plugins-community" }],
  "skills": [{ "name": "cua-driver", "repo": "https://github.com/trycua/cua", "path": "libs/cua-driver/rust/Skills/cua-driver", "ref": "main" }]
}
```

- Plugins are provisioned through the Claude Code CLI: the marketplace `source`
  is registered only when missing, then `claude plugin install <name>@<marketplace>
  --scope user --yes` runs. A plugin counts as present when
  `claude plugin list --json` already reports `<name>@<marketplace>`, in any scope.
- Skills are fetched with a shallow sparse `git clone` into
  `<state dir>/upstream/skills/<name>` and linked from `~/.claude/skills/<name>`,
  the same link shape the harness uses for its own skills. A skill counts as
  present when `~/.claude/skills/<name>` exists, whoever created it, so a
  harness-owned or hand-made skill of the same name is left alone. A fetched
  directory without `SKILL.md` is rejected and leaves no link behind.
- Provisioning runs only after the native activation receipt is sealed, and it
  never changes install success. A missing `claude` CLI, an unreachable remote,
  or a failed plugin install is reported as an `upstream ...` message on the
  install result while the issueops install itself stays `ok`. This keeps the
  issueops install path independent of third-party tooling.
- `issueops install --dry-run --json` reports the plan (`planned` /
  `skipped`) without touching the host.
- The cache lives outside `skills/`, so the stale-link prune that removes
  deleted harness skills never touches upstream skill links.

Choosing the entry kind. Declare an upstream as a `plugin` whenever the project
publishes a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and as a `skill` only when no
marketplace exists for it. Three reasons the plugin kind is preferred:

- It is the upstream author's own documented install path, and it carries a
  version the host can update.
- A plugin's skills are namespaced `<plugin>:<skill>` in the host, so a plugin
  whose skill shares a name with a harness skill coexists with it instead of
  competing for `~/.claude/skills/<name>`.
- The host materializes the whole plugin, so the upstream `LICENSE` comes with
  it. A `skill` entry sparse-fetches one subdirectory, which usually leaves the
  repository's root `LICENSE` behind — check the fetched directory carries its
  own notice before declaring a skill entry for third-party code.

A `skill` entry whose name matches a skill the harness itself ships can never
install: the harness links its own `skills/<name>` first, so the presence check
always skips the upstream. Declare such a project as a plugin, or accept that
the entry is a provenance record only.

## Omo Native

Omo stores runtime configuration in its branded roots and user skills in the
Senpi agent directory:

- User skills: `~/.omo/agent/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- User MCP: `~/.omo/mcp.json`
- User lifecycle extension: `~/.omo/extensions/issueops.js`
- Project skills and MCP: `.omo/skills/*` and `.omo/mcp.json` only with
  explicit project-local opt-in.

The managed extension maps Omo `session_start` and accepted `session_compact`
events to `issueops hook session-start --json` and
`issueops hook post-compact --json`. It injects compact project-doc context
as a hidden custom message without triggering a new turn. Install/update strict
readback seals both the MCP file and extension bytes before activation commits.

Checks:

```bash
test -f ~/.omo/agent/skills/atomic-commit-push/SKILL.md
test -f ~/.omo/agent/skills/ui-ux-craft/SKILL.md
test -f ~/.omo/mcp.json
test -f ~/.omo/extensions/issueops.js
```

Agent-harness does not install or gate the external Omo runtime itself; install
Omo through its official distribution path.

Omo tool-conformance live verification is an explicit, potentially billable
operation. It requires both the live opt-in and an explicit Omo model; the
default live host list remains Codex/Claude.

```bash
ISSUEOPS_TOOL_CONFORMANCE_LIVE=1 issueops contract conformance live \
  --hosts omo \
  --model omo=provider/model \
  --profile clean \
  --target-completed 1 \
  --max-attempts-per-case 3 \
  --json
```

The Omo runner resolves the installed native `omo` command and optional strict
auth source before creating a private temporary `HOME` and agent root. On Unix,
the auth leaf is opened relative to a no-follow directory handle and its
identity, mode, size, and modification time must remain stable across the
bounded read. Symlinks and anything other than a regular mode-0600 file fail
closed. Private-root cleanup is part of both preflight and episode success; a
cleanup failure returns `private_root_cleanup_failed` and cannot leave a success
report.

Production preflight compares the supplied lifecycle module byte-for-byte with
the canonical module generated for the exact harness binary. This proves source
identity, while actual async JavaScript behavior remains deterministic test
evidence and native live behavior remains explicit live evidence. The runner
uses explicit generated lifecycle and guard extensions, one direct MCP tool,
JSON print mode, and ambient discovery disabled. A report with only
installed/preflight or deterministic test evidence remains `not-run` or
`unavailable`; only a completed live episode may report `supported`.

## IssueOps Host Rule

Hooks only inject static project-doc context. They do not create issues, edit files, run tests, wait on background jobs, prepare branches/worktrees, open PRs/MRs, reply to review threads, merge, clean up branches/worktrees, or block tool events. The main agent loop owns the user-visible `problem -> grill -> issue linkage -> plan -> compatibility-review -> implement -> ai-slop-clean -> feedback -> pr -> done -> post-done cleanup` workflow through `issueops ...` CLI/MCP state. The durable phase enum has no artifact-linkage or cleanup labels; explicit IssueOps commands own CAS, lease authority, remote writes, verification, publication, and cleanup. Hook output is neither an enforcement path nor ownership evidence.
