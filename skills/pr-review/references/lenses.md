# Finder lenses

Optional detail for the actor contract in `../SKILL.md`. Each finder owns one
unit (bundle × shard), applying its lenses separately. Finders never post.
Below max the main agent reads units sequentially; only max dispatches agents.
A lens applies when a changed file matches `applies` (tags from `context.json`).

| id | applies | lens |
|---|---|---|
| `logic` | always | Correctness of the changed control/data flow: wrong condition, off-by-one, null/undefined path, lost `0`/`''`/`false`, wrong field name, wrong signature, async misuse (missing await, unhandled rejection), state mutation order, error mapping. |
| `boundary` | always | Cross-file consequences: every changed exported symbol — who calls it, does every caller still hold? Every changed call — does the callee's real definition accept it? Renamed/removed fields, generated artifacts vs source, event payload shapes. |
| `security` | `security`, `controller`, `gateway`, `dto`, `ops`, or diff mentions auth/token/secret/permission/env | Auth/authz (object-level IDOR), input validation on external inputs, secrets in code/log/CI, injection (SQL/command/SSRF), server-side re-validation of client flags, sensitive data in logs/responses. |
| `data` | `db`, `migration`, or diff touches repository/query/transaction | N+1 in loops, unbounded reads, missing transaction boundary across multi-writes (state the partial-failure), index/order assumptions, `up()`/`down()` symmetry, destructive migrations, cross-domain DB access. |
| `async` | `async`, `gateway`, or diff touches kafka/queue/stream/websocket/retry/timeout | Ack-before-durable-write, lost idempotency, missing timeout/cancellation on external calls, backpressure/disconnect cleanup, retry storms, ordering assumptions, transaction-then-publish ordering. |
| `contract` | `dto`, `controller`, `gateway`, `generated` | Public API contract drift: DTO ↔ validators ↔ Swagger/OpenAPI ↔ actual behavior; proto ↔ generated TS; response shape/status/error docs; PATCH-vs-PUT and other repo conventions. |
| `tests` | always | Do the added/changed tests actually exercise the changed behavior? Would they fail before the fix? Missing regression for a bugfix, mocked-away risk that needs a real dependency, assertions that can't fail, tests asserting the wrong thing. |
| `rules` | always | Compliance with the repo rule pack (`context.json` → `rule_pack`): only rules whose globs match the changed file, only on changed lines, only when the rule text explicitly covers it. Cite the rule file. |
| `scope` | always | Description ↔ diff alignment against the CUMULATIVE diff: hidden scope (deploy/CI/migration/secret/generated changes not mentioned), missing migration/rollback notes, behavior changes not described, commits that contradict the description. |
| `intent` | when `linked_issues` is non-empty | Does the change do what the linked issue asks — each background claim, acceptance criterion, checklist item, and table row in the issue body mapped to code/tests in the diff? Report unmet criteria (with the issue line quoted), silent extra scope, and places where the issue's own analysis (e.g. "producer missing at X") is contradicted by the code. Cite `summary.md` Linked issues section lines. |

`mr_context.py` selects the applicable lenses from file tags and diff keywords and writes
them, with this table's `lens` text, to `<out_dir>/workflow_args.json`. Prior-review
history is handled by the deterministic prescreen and the `tracer` skeptic, not a finder lens.

## Finder prompt

The executable finder/skeptic prompts live in `workflow.js`. Use the root's
host adapter and deterministic prescreen, never hand-build `workflow_args.json`.
At max on other hosts, dispatch one finder per unit, then a tracer per surviving
candidate and a reproducer only where the tracer did not refute, using the
root's verdict contract. This reference never upgrades an inline level to max.
Give each finder ONE pack and its bundle's lenses; never share findings between finders.
Each finder is one **unit** (lens bundle × shard): it reads exactly one pack file
(`pack/<unit>.md`) as its first message, whole, then applies each lens of its bundle
separately and tags every candidate with `lens`. It has 10 assistant messages in total and
must batch follow-up reads into message 2. It returns at most `perLensCap` candidates per
lens (`max(3, ceil(maxCandidates / lenses) + 1)` — the cap used to be 6 and half of what
finders produced was discarded unread). `mr_context.py → LENS_BUNDLES` defines the bundles,
`files_for_lens` decides which files a lens sees (mirrors the `applies` column) and
`shard_files` bin-packs the bundle's union under ~150 KB of diff.

Reference copy of the finder contract (keep in sync with workflow.js):

```
You are one inspector in a formal design inspection. Lens: <lens id> — <lens text>.
Repository checkout at head: <worktree or repo_dir> (read-only; never edit, never checkout, never post).
Pack file (read first, whole, one call): <out_dir>/pack/<unit>.md — the slice's diff, defs, rules, threads, lessons.
Budget: at most 10 assistant messages; batch independent reads in one message.
Rule pack files are listed in summary.md; read the ones whose globs match the files you inspect.
<if codegraph: `codegraph explore "<symbol>"` prints definitions + call paths — use it before grep.>

Inspect ONLY through your lens. For every candidate defect you MUST, before reporting:
1. Open the real definition of every symbol the claim depends on (not inferred from a call site).
2. Walk one hop upstream (who calls / what validates the input before it gets here) and one hop
   downstream (who consumes the result) and state what you saw.
3. Confirm the defect is on lines this change added/modified (see hunks in summary.md), or that
   the change makes an existing problem newly reachable.
Report a candidate only if you can state a concrete failure scenario (input/state → wrong result).
Do NOT report: style, naming, things a linter/typechecker/CI catches, pre-existing issues on
untouched lines, speculative refactors, "consider adding" without a failure scenario.

Return JSON only:
{"lens":"<id>","reviewed_files":["<every exact unit file path, once>"],"inspected":["<files/symbols actually read in depth>"],
 "candidates":[{"path":"...","new_line":N,"end_line":N|null,"severity":"critical|high|medium|low",
   "category":"bug|security|performance|business-logic|data|api-contract|test|rule|scope",
   "title":"<Korean, one sentence>","what":"<Korean>","why":"<Korean failure scenario>","how":"<Korean fix>",
   "evidence":["path:line — what it proves", ...],"upstream":"<what you saw>","downstream":"<what you saw>",
   "suggestion":"<replacement code or null>","rule":"<rule file or null>","confidence":0-100,"newly_reachable":false}],
 "verified_ok":[{"concern":"<우려, 한 구절>","why_ok":"<왜 괜찮은지 한 문장, 근거 file:line 포함>","loc":"file:line","thread":"<contradicted existing thread id or null>"}]}
```

Rules baked into the prompt: at most `perLensCap` candidates and 3 `verified_ok` per lens;
`suggestion` is required for `api-contract` and any one-line decorator/description/config
fix; a hop you cannot find caps confidence at 50 and is stated, never guessed. `reviewed_files`
is the exact file-level coverage receipt for the unit; missing or duplicate assignments degrade
the whole review instead of letting an incomplete scan look clean.

```
```

Severity guide: `critical` = data loss/corruption, auth bypass, secret exposure, payment/quota
error; `high` = wrong behavior on a real path, partial writes, crash on reachable input;
`medium` = degraded behavior, missing timeout/cleanup, contract drift consumers will notice;
`low` = correctness-adjacent hygiene with a real (rare) scenario. Anything without a scenario is
not a finding.
