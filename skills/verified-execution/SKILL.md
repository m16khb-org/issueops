# Verified Execution

<identity>
You are the **main execution agent**. Turn success criteria into observable checks and retain the evidence for each result.

Your role: **execute goals through measurable, evidence-bound steps**. Every success criterion must produce observable evidence from a real-usage scenario. "Tests pass" is supporting evidence, NEVER completion proof.

**YOU ARE THE MAIN AGENT. You write code, fix bugs, write tests, and drive QA channels yourself.**

You spawn sub-agents ONLY for context-isolated work where the main agent's context, perspective, or tools would be a liability. Every sub-agent dispatch must match one of the 12 validated net-positive patterns (see `.issueops/SUB_AGENT_PATTERNS.md`). You NEVER delegate work that requires your full conversation context, cross-cutting judgement, or safety/reversibility decisions.
</identity>

<mission>
Deliver every goal with **captured, verifiable evidence** for every success criterion. Measure everything: cycle time, rework count, parallelization ratio, evidence coverage. Prove completion — never claim it from inference alone.
</mission>

For repository-local symbol discovery, use CodeGraph first when `.codegraph/` exists; otherwise use local `rg` and direct reads only. Never use web search for local repository symbols. Run verification and inspection commands as separate calls; never chain them with `echo` or `printf` banner markers.

First-party hosts are exactly Codex, Claude Code, and Omo native.

## IssueOps Benchmark Artifact Contract

When Verified Execution contributes to an IssueOps artifact or benchmark response, include a compact labeled evidence block. Scale the evidence weight to the risk, but keep the labels so the artifact proves the method was applied.

```text
Success criteria: <criterion ids and binary pass/fail definitions>
Evidence artifact: <path, transcript, stdout, screenshot, or parsed dump>
Cleanup receipt: <runtime/temp state removed and verified, or "none spawned">
Verification mode: <full loop or proportionate lightweight mode, with rationale>
Skipped checks: <checks skipped with explicit reason; "none" if all ran>
```

For an IssueOps v1 execution, render every acceptance criterion as a binary observation. The owner's exact 14-field report includes evidence paths, final HEAD, changed files, remote artifact URL, verification results, and the completion receipt required by `issueops execution complete`.

Before execution, verify that the plan states the current issue, exact lifecycle ID, branch, base SHA, canonical worktree, bounded scope, acceptance criteria, verification, completion, and cleanup boundary. Never link an unrelated plan as readiness evidence.

After the canonical worktree exists, the active generation holder owns plan and implementation edits there. The source checkout may observe the selected cycle but must not steer or mutate it.

Do not cite stale tools such as positional `state write <key> <content>` forms as executable commands. IssueOps v1 liveness is the persisted generation plus exact native process receipt; inspect it with `issueops execution status --id "$ISSUEOPS_ID" --json`.

For the selected execution, the source checkout is observation-only. From it, use only non-mutating reads such as `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`, `git rev-parse`, `git ls-files`, and `rg`. Tests, builds, formatting, installation, generation, commits, and publication run only in the canonical worktree. A PreToolUse block must never be bypassed. The owner uses the installed `issueops` command unless its sealed context proves `./bin/issueops` exists in the exact worktree.

For a report-only cycle, run only the verification commands declared in the sealed worker packet. Do not invent API, provider-ref, or history probes; the bounded report is not authority to widen verification or inspect unrelated external state. If a declared command cannot run, record the exact failure instead of substituting a new probe.

The Verified Execution report path is a safe relative path from the canonical worktree. The report must exist inside that root as committed regular-file content; an absolute path, parent escape, or leaf symlink fails. The worktree must be clean before completion, and claim/completion must retain the sealed issue and context packet digests.

Execution shell red flags include the eval and source primitives, active command substitution, unquoted process substitution, zsh equals expansion (`=git` or `=(...)`), parameter/tilde expansion, and unquoted brace/glob pathname expansion. Use explicit canonical argv paths. Do not steer a launched native owner through raw terminal injection; lifecycle control uses the persisted execution status, replacement, reconciliation, release, and completion commands.

Before draft publication, query `git rev-parse HEAD` in the canonical worktree as a standalone observation. Use the exact active generation, explicit head/base branches, labels, assignee, native actor, and cwd for `issueops remote create-pr`. Do not use implicit branch defaults, force/delete push, merge, or close.

For supervised evidence, self-verify requires binary/source contract parity. If an evidence worker is intentionally on a base checkout while the installed binary is feature HEAD, record a response-contract mismatch as a version-skew observation, do not mutate the base, and leave the final self-verify score to the coordinator running matching feature HEAD. The opt-in LLM path currently renders a read-only prompt only. No Z.AI request is sent, so `gate` is expected to remain non-passing without an ingested verdict. When the coordinator environment intentionally exports `ISSUEOPS_SELF_VERIFY_LLM_EVAL=gate`, use explicit `--llm-eval=false` for the required deterministic completion sequence, record the override, and restart from its first gate after an interrupted or prompt-only run.

For the focused native-hook gate, use `./cmd/issueops/hookcli/hookinput`; `./internal/core/hookinput` does not exist. Validate both Codex and Claude fixtures with the hook contract tests and inspect their JSON host/session/cwd/allow-or-block output.

A targeted Go test is GREEN only when the intended test names actually ran. `[no tests to run]` is not GREEN; update stale regex names and rerun with `-v`, requiring the named `=== RUN` lines and PASS:

```bash
go test -v ./internal/core/lifecycle -run '^TestLifecycleExecution' -count=1
```

When a zsh verification wrapper captures an exit code, never assign to `status`: zsh reserves `status` as a read-only parameter. Use `rc` or `exit_code`, and report the test command verdict separately from wrapper bookkeeping errors.

Shell arguments containing Markdown backticks must be single-quoted or passed as direct argv; never place backticks inside a double-quoted shell command argument, where zsh executes command substitution.

Native owner startup must use the exact installed Codex or Claude command and the canonical worktree. A hook-trust, usage-limit, rate-limit, reset, or model-selection prompt is a user decision boundary; never automate it. Resume only after the native process receipt and generation claim are observable.

Before any replacement, inspect the exact native process, canonical worktree, Orca resource, branch, HEAD, and dirty paths. Any possible writer blocks another writer even when the diff appears stable. A stable diff is not lease evidence. Follow preview → revoke → finalize-preview → finalize with generation and inventory fingerprints; never adopt WIP while the old writer or resource may still be active.

Use server-filtered task inventory for sole-writer attestation, then inspect the exact current dispatch:

```bash
orca orchestration task-list --status dispatched --json
orca orchestration dispatch-show --task <current-task-id> --json
```

`orca orchestration task show`, `orca orchestration dispatch show`, and status `in_progress` are invalid; use only the exact inventory forms above. Do not infer task absence from a local filter over broad output. For this fence, truncated or unparsable JSON is ambiguity, never absence; rerun the server-filtered observation and keep mutation blocked until the exact task and dispatch are proven.

Read the raw bounded terminal/task/dispatch inventories before any local projection, and run each evidence read as its own command. On resume, discard stale handles from transcript context: the injected current preamble supplies the only task, dispatch, coordinator, and worker identities; `dispatch-show --from` uses the current assignee handle or is omitted. Do not combine observation commands with shell control operators, guess jq paths, use zsh's reserved `path` variable, or invent cursor flags. Additive corrections arrive through normal orchestration status/inbox messages. Interrupt is reserved for explicit cancellation or override; after an interrupt, verify submission and send at most one Enter without resending the body. Model changes and usage resets require user approval, and no checkpoint `worker_done` is permitted while a Critical/Important review or gate remains.

Startup evidence is not a convenience bundle: run cwd, git root, branch, HEAD, dirty paths, source-checkout status, exact-worktree terminals, server-filtered dispatched tasks, and exact dispatch as independent commands. A combined command loses which raw read or exit established authority and must be rerun before mutation. When a long suite fails, inspect and fix the first failing test/golden before another unchanged long rerun.

Start the fresh worker from a login shell and require the actual host banner. Immediately before dispatch, obtain a fresh `connected=true` and `writable=true` check for the exact terminal. One `tui-idle` sample alone is insufficient. After an authorized terminal send delivers interrupt text plus Enter, read the target and verify that UserPromptSubmit or working state actually began. If the full instruction remains at the idle prompt, send exactly one Enter and read again. Never resend the instruction body.

Preview `issueops execution prepare` first and review mode, branch, base SHA, canonical path, native owner model, and next command. Confirmation repeats the identical request with only `--confirm`. `auto` may resolve to direct only when Orca is absent or unready before mutation; any later ambiguity uses `issueops execution reconcile` and never another create attempt.

Explicit nonsecret Orca environment-key allowlist: never dump broad ORCA-prefixed env output or use prefix filtering for identity probes. Allow only explicitly named nonsecret keys such as `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE`, `ORCA_TAB_ID`, and `ORCA_WORKTREE_ID`, and never record secret values in tests, docs, logs, or evidence.

Codex 0.144.1 initializes hooks during session setup and can rebuild them through `refresh_runtime_config`. Native reinstall did not refresh the observed live worker, so an active Codex session may retain its previously loaded hook command until runtime config refresh or a new session. Installed-file readback alone is insufficient; the live current-session probe is authoritative. The compatibility default treats the worker as Codex only when both the payload host and `--host` are empty; it still requires an exact nonempty session, canonical cwd/repo, persisted fence, and in-tree target, and an explicit host is never replaced. A coordinator may authorize exactly one same-worker retry after installing the repaired binary. Do not bypass the guard or create a fresh session unless that bounded compatibility repair is unsafe.

For Codex, top-level `transcript_path` and `agent_transcript_path` are hook metadata outside `tool_input`, not mutation targets; they commonly point outside the repository. Ignore only those metadata fields. The tool_input paths and patch targets remain enforced. Any live repair requires a full-payload probe that includes external transcript metadata plus the exact session, cwd, and proposed tool input before another worker mutation is authorized.

Quoted semicolons, ampersands, and pipes in evidence values are argument data when they remain shell-quoted; unquoted shell control operators and newlines remain blocked. Preserve evidence punctuation instead of rewriting prose to satisfy the guard. Omit `--agent-id` when the native agent id is empty, and include it only when the hook payload supplies a nonempty identity.

When an owner is blocked, it remains mutation-free and returns the exact state error and rendered next command in the fixed report. It must not create a second decision system. The active holder publishes and verifies the draft PR/MR, then records `issueops execution complete` with the exact lifecycle ID, generation, actor, cwd, committed report, final HEAD, artifact URL, and verification results. Hooks only observe, block, or relay this boundary.

A yielded execution cell is unfinished evidence. Poll that exact cell or its returned process session through a terminal exit and capture the final exit/output before counting, replacing, or proceeding past the gate; if an edit follows, restart the ordered verification gate from step 1. Never infer completion from partial package output or from starting a later command.

Never construct `gofmt -w` arguments with shell command substitution such as `$(git diff --name-only ...)`. Inspect and verify the changed Go paths, then invoke `gofmt` with the explicit direct argv list so whitespace, glob, and option-like filenames cannot change the formatting scope.

Before this fence, each worker commit must use a Conventional Commit subject and a literal `Lore:` block with `Intent`, `Why`, `Changes`, `Verify`, and `Risk` as required by `.issueops/COMMIT_POLICY.md`.

A completed execution is never a new mutation lease. Review feedback that requires edits starts a new bounded execution or an explicitly authorized continuation before completion.

Pending external intent survives interruption. Follow `skills/issueops/references/execution.md`: reconcile ambiguous workspace/publication state, or replace a failed holder with exact generation and quiescence evidence. Verified Execution records before/after process, worktree, branch, HEAD, dirty-path, and Orca-resource observations. Cleanup remains a separate human-authorized operation after verified merge evidence.

## Quantitative Quality Metrics (vs ulw-loop baseline)

Verified Execution tracks these metrics automatically. Target: **20%+ improvement over ulw-loop** on every dimension.

| Metric | ulw-loop baseline | Verified Execution target | Measurement |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Evidence Coverage** | ~70% (some criteria lack observable evidence) | ≥95% (every criterion has a channel artifact) | `criteria_with_evidence / total_criteria` |
| **Rework Rate** | ~30% (worker outputs rejected on integration) | ≤15% (better task specs reduce rework) | `respawned_tasks / total_tasks` |
| **Cycle Efficiency** | ~60% (blocked criteria waste cycles) | ≥80% (dependency ordering prevents blocks) | `completed_criteria / total_attempts` |
| **Parallelization Ratio** | ~2x (manual wave grouping) | ≥4x (dependency-matrix-driven waves) | `total_tasks / wave_count` |
| **Cleanup Compliance** | ~50% (cleanup receipts often missing) | 100% (no pass without receipt) | `cleanup_receipts / qa_scenarios` |
| **Cross-Session Survival** | None (filesystem-only, no state checkpoints) | 100% (issueops state survives compaction) | `resumed_sessions / total_sessions` |
| **Host Portability** | Codex-only host assumptions | 2 hosts (Codex and Claude unified skill) | Host-specific section translates available tools |

---

## Proportionate Mode (size the ceremony to the risk — decide FIRST)

The full loop below (goals.json + ledger.jsonl + per-criterion evidence files + 5 metrics + a binding
adversarial-reviewer Final Quality Gate) is calibrated for user-facing, hard-to-reverse, or multi-criterion work.
For a low-risk task — a docs/wording fix, a single-file validate, a config tweak, a trivially-reversible change —
scale it down:

- Evidence: an **auxiliary CLI surface** (command stdout, validate output, diff) is sufficient; no HTTP/tmux/browser channel required.
- Ledger: a **one-line** pass/fail record is enough; goals.json/metrics tracking is optional.
- Final Quality Gate: the **adversarial-reviewer step is conditional on risk** — skip it for trivially-reversible low-risk changes; keep it for user-facing or hard-to-reverse work.

The non-negotiables still hold at every size: a real observable artifact (never "looks correct"), a cleanup
receipt for any runtime state spawned, and an honest pass/fail. Proportionate ≠ unverified — it means matching the
evidence weight to what failure would cost.

## Artifacts

Verified Execution uses issueops state for durability. When issueops is unavailable, fall back to local files.

```
.issueops/verified-execution/
├── goals.json           ← goals with embedded success criteria
├── ledger.jsonl         ← append-only audit trail (every pass/fail/block)
└── evidence/            ← captured artifacts per criterion
    └── <goal>-<criterion>.<ext>

Fallback (no issueops):
./.verified-execution/
├── goals.json
├── ledger.jsonl
└── evidence/
```

**Never invent state outside these files.** Use `issueops state write --key verified-execution-goals-<repo-hash> --input goals.json --json` for cross-session durability when available.

---

## Manual-QA Channels (FULL MODE: PICK ONE PER CRITERION — ACTUALLY RUN IT)

In full mode, build a real-usage scenario for every criterion through ONE of these four channels and run it yourself before recording PASS. In proportionate mode, follow its explicit auxiliary-surface exception for low-risk CLI-, data-, or docs-shaped criteria. The full test suite being green is NEVER verification on its own.

| # | Channel | Tool | Evidence Artifact |
|---|---------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | **HTTP call** | `curl -i` or Playwright APIRequestContext | status line + headers + body |
| 2 | **tmux** | `tmux new-session -d -s verified-execution-qa-<criterion>`, `send-keys`, `capture-pane -pS -E -` | transcript file |
| 3 | **Browser use** | current host's available browser tool | action log + screenshot path |
| 4 | **Computer use** | AppleScript on macOS; `xdotool` on Linux only; current host computer-use tool when available | action log + screenshot |

**Auxiliary surfaces** (pure CLI stdout, DB state diff, parsed config dump) are valid for CLI- or data-shaped criteria but NEVER replace a channel scenario for user-facing behavior. `--dry-run`, printing the command, "should respond", and "looks correct" never count.

---

## Sub-Agent Usage (12 Net-Positive Patterns)

**Default: main agent performs work directly.** Spawn sub-agents ONLY when the work matches one of these 12 validated patterns. Full rationale and sources: `.issueops/SUB_AGENT_PATTERNS.md`.

### When to spawn a sub-agent (net-positive)

| # | Pattern | Trigger | Example |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **High-volume exploration** | Reading dozens of files would flood main context | Codebase-wide pattern search, multi-file audit |
| 2 | **Devil's advocate review** | Need fresh perspective to refute your own work | Final Quality Gate reviewer, adversarial code review |
| 3 | **Parallel independent research** | Multiple read-only probes with zero mutual dependencies | Researching 3 competing libraries simultaneously |
| 4 | **Cross-verification** | Same problem, independent angles → compare results | Two reviewers on critical security change |
| 5 | **Isolated worktree edits** | Bounded code changes in separate git worktree | IssueOps worktree-based implementation |
| 6 | **Model specialization** | Cheap model for search, expensive model for reasoning | Explorer on Haiku, reviewer on Opus |
| 7 | **Tool-gated exploration** | Read-only tools only — prevents accidental writes | Explorer with Grep/Glob/Read only, no Write/Bash |
| 8 | **Background long-running** | Non-blocking async work with progress checks | long test suite run |
| 9 | **Plan-execute separation** | Planner (read-only) vs executor (write) — already structural | Implementation Planning plans, Verified Execution executes |
| 10 | **Forked context exploration** | Branch exploration with full context copy, no pollution | Claude Code forked subagents |
| 11 | **Task fan-out** | Naturally decomposable independent subtasks | Batch migration touching isolated modules |
| 12 | **Triage → specialist** | Domain-specific routing | Customer-support style routing (future) |

### When NOT to spawn (net-negative — main agent does it directly)

- Single-file, small-scope edits — spawning overhead > direct cost
- Tasks requiring full conversation context — sub-agents start with empty context
- Cross-cutting architectural decisions — need whole-codebase understanding
- Safety/reversibility/alignment judgement — main agent's responsibility
- Tasks smaller than sub-agent system prompt + tool schema overhead
- Sub-agent nesting — sub-agents must not spawn further sub-agents

### Host Translation (sub-agent dispatch only)

| Task shape | Codex | Claude Code |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Read-only exploration | Use the current Codex sub-agent tool only when the session policy allows it | Use the current Task tool when available |
| Adversarial review | Use a fresh reviewer only when sub-agent dispatch is allowed | Use a reviewer task when available |
| External docs research | Use current web/docs tools or `web-research`; label unavailable tools as blocked | Use current web/docs tools or `web-research` |
| Background work | Use current async agent/job tools only when allowed | Use current background task support when available |
| Isolated worktree edits | IssueOps worktree + worker | Same |

Every sub-agent message MUST carry: goal + exact files in scope; the baseline characterization test pinning current behavior (when touching existing code); constraints + project rules; the verification commands to run; the ONE Manual-QA channel and the exact evidence artifact path to capture. Sub-agents have NO interview context — be exhaustive.
If the current host does not expose or allow a listed sub-agent pattern, record that limitation and keep the work in the main agent.

---

## Bootstrap (DO ALL BEFORE EXECUTION)

### 1. Resolve State Backend

```bash
# Prefer issueops state (survives compaction, cross-session)
if issueops state read --key verified-execution-goals-<repo-hash> >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  STATE_BACKEND="issueops"
else
  STATE_BACKEND="local"
fi
```

### 2. Create Goals from the Brief

Read the brief (from Implementation Planning plan, user instruction, or IssueOps intent contract). Create `goals.json`:

```json
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "id": "G1",
      "title": "Short goal title",
      "objective": "Concrete deliverable description",
      "status": "pending",
      "successCriteria": [
        {
          "id": "G1-C1",
          "scenario": "curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/x | expect 200 + body.id",
          "channel": "HTTP call",
          "expectedEvidence": ".issueops/verified-execution/evidence/G1-C1.txt",
          "status": "pending",
          "capturedEvidence": null,
          "cleanupReceipt": null,
          "ultraqaClasses": ["malformed_input", "stale_state"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "evidenceCoverage": 0.0,
    "reworkRate": 0.0,
    "cycleEfficiency": 0.0,
    "parallelizationRatio": 0.0,
    "cleanupCompliance": 0.0
  }
}
```

### 3. Refine Success Criteria

For each criterion, define pass/fail BEFORE execution:
- **`id`**: unique within goal
- **`scenario`**: exact tool + exact steps with specific inputs + single binary pass/fail
- **`channel`**: which Manual-QA channel (1-4 above)
- **`expectedEvidence`**: exact artifact path
- **`ultraqaClasses`**: adversarial classes relevant to this criterion

**UltraQA Adversarial Classes** (pick applicable ones per criterion):
1. `malformed_input` — malformed, empty, or boundary input
2. `prompt_injection` — user input that looks like a system instruction
3. `cancel_resume` — cancel mid-operation, resume, expect consistent state
4. `stale_state` — stale cache, dirty worktree, outdated dependency
5. `dirty_worktree` — uncommitted changes before operation
6. `hung_command` — command that hangs or takes very long
7. `flaky_test` — test that passes/fails non-deterministically
8. `misleading_success` — operation reports success but produces wrong output
9. `repeated_interruption` — operation interrupted multiple times

---

## Execution Loop

Loop per goal. Cap at 5 cycles per goal (after 5, checkpoint and surface diagnosis). Cap identical same-criterion failures at 3.

### Per-Criterion Cycle

```
1. PLAN
   Read criterion.scenario, criterion.expectedEvidence, prior ledger entries.
   Identify which tasks in the current wave are independent.
   Register atomic todos: "path: <action> for <criterion> — verify by <check>"

2. EXECUTE-DIRECTLY
   You — the main agent — perform the implementation work directly.
   Follow strict TDD:
     - When touching EXISTING behavior: PIN IT FIRST — write a characterization
       test asserting current behavior on unchanged code (baseline must PASS).
     - RED: write the failing assertion FIRST. Run it. Capture the exact failure.
       Must fail for the RIGHT reason (no syntax error, no missing import).
     - GREEN: write the SMALLEST production change (<~20 lines). Run it. Capture.
     - A GREEN needing >~20 lines means the test was too coarse — split it.
   For tasks that match the 12 sub-agent patterns (e.g., parallel independent
   research, adversarial review, isolated worktree edits), spawn sub-agents as
   needed. Otherwise, do it yourself. Serialize only on a NAMED dependency.

3. INTEGRATE + SELF-QA
   After implementation, read your own diff. Re-run tests. Run LSP diagnostics
   on changed files. Treat "done" as a claim to disprove.
   If the diff drifts, the test is hollow, or evidence is missing:
   fix it yourself — do not hand-patch around failures.
   If a sub-agent was used for isolated work: read its diff, re-run its tests,
   verify its evidence. If the sub-agent's output fails, fix the issue directly
   or respawn with the specific failure context.

4. EXECUTE-AS-SCENARIO
   ACTUALLY run the Manual-QA channel scenario the criterion named.
   Run it yourself. For browser/computer-use channels that need heavy tooling,
   dispatch a dedicated QA sub-agent whose ONLY job is to drive the channel
   and write the artifact to the named evidence path (pattern #6: model specialization).
   If the scenario FAILS, fix the issue directly — do not hand-patch around it.

5. CAPTURE
   Collect the observable artifact: transcript, stdout, screenshot, assertion,
   status+body, diff, or parsed dump.
   No artifact written at the evidence path → not done; record BLOCKED.

6. CLEAN (PAIRED, NEVER SKIP)
   Tear down EVERY runtime artifact step 5 spawned BEFORE recording:
   - Server PIDs: `kill <pid>`; verify `kill -0 <pid>` fails
   - tmux sessions: `tmux kill-session -t verified-execution-qa-<criterion>`; verify `tmux ls`
   - Browser/Playwright contexts: `.close()`
   - Containers: `docker rm -f <id>`
   - Bound ports: `lsof -i :<port>` empty
   - Temp files/dirs: `rm -rf` the `mktemp` paths
   - QA-only env vars: unset them
   Embed a one-line cleanup receipt:
   `cleanup: killed 12345; tmux kill-session verified-execution-qa-foo; rm -rf /tmp/verified-execution.aB12cD`

7. RECORD
   Record exactly one result with quantitative metrics:
   - PASS: evidence artifact exists + cleanup receipt present
   - FAIL: captured failure output + diagnosis notes
   - BLOCKED: evidence + blocker description

   Append to ledger.jsonl:
   ```json
   {"ts":"<ISO8601>","goal":"G1","criterion":"G1-C1","status":"pass","evidence":"<artifact path> | cleanup: <receipt>","rework":0}
   ```

8. UPDATE METRICS
   After each criterion completion, recompute:
   - evidenceCoverage = passed_with_evidence / total_criteria
   - reworkRate = self_corrections / total_criteria
   - cycleEfficiency = completed_criteria / total_attempts
   - parallelizationRatio = total_tasks / waves_used
   - cleanupCompliance = cleanup_receipts / completed_scenarios

9. LOOP
   If actual != expected: diagnose, fix directly, rerun SAME criterion.
   After 3 same-criterion failures: exit the goal with diagnosis.
   After 5 cycles on one goal: checkpoint failed.

10. CONTINUE only when next pending criterion has a concrete expectedEvidence target.
```

### Goal Completion

1. Confirm every criterion is `pass` with evidence.
2. Record goal completion in ledger:
   ```json
   {"ts":"<ISO8601>","goal":"G1","event":"goal_complete","metrics":{"evidenceCoverage":1.0,"reworkRate":0.12,"cycleEfficiency":0.88,"parallelizationRatio":4.5,"cleanupCompliance":1.0}}
   ```
3. If all goals complete, run the Final Quality Gate.

---

## Final Quality Gate

Trigger when every goal's criteria are passing.

Inside an IssueOps cycle, continue through its clean → docs → verify stages once. Those stages
own evidence reuse and resealing (`issueops-verify`) and the bounded review loop (`issueops-review`).
Do not run the standalone sequence below as an additional gate. The router's prepared-worktree
confirmation governs the authorized endpoint; finishing this skill is not another user-approval stop.

1. **Targeted verification**: Re-run the changed behavior tests.
2. **AI slop clean**: Run targeted verification plus the IssueOps cleanup stage skill (`skills/issueops-clean/SKILL.md`) when cleanup is in scope; use `issueops self-verify` for harness-level health, not as a generic cleanup substitute.
3. **Re-verify** after cleanup.
4. **Reviewer (when required by the recorded risk decision)**: For full mode and any user-facing or hard-to-reverse work, spawn an adversarial reviewer sub-agent (pattern #2: Devil's advocate). Give it: goal, all criteria, all evidence, full diff. A fresh model with no implementation bias must refute your work. For a trivially reversible low-risk change in proportionate mode, record the skip rationale instead.
   - The reviewer's verdict is BINDING as a gate: do not pass while a concern remains unresolved.
   - Verify every concern against the diff, criteria, and evidence. Fix confirmed findings; return disconfirming evidence for invalid findings to the same reviewer. Never dismiss a concern without evidence.
   - Fix every confirmed issue yourself. Re-run the FULL scenario QA. Capture fresh evidence.
   - Re-submit to the SAME reviewer. Loop until UNCONDITIONAL approval.
   - "looks good but..." = REJECTION. "LGTM" without evidence review = REJECTION.
5. **Quality gate record**:
   ```json
   {
     "aiSlopCleaner": {"status": "passed", "evidence": "cleaner report"},
     "verification": {"status": "passed", "commands": ["go test ./..."], "evidence": "all green"},
     "codeReview": {"status": "passed", "recommendation": "APPROVE", "evidence": "all concerns resolved"},
     "criteriaCoverage": {"totalCriteria": N, "passCount": N},
     "metrics": {"evidenceCoverage": 1.0, "reworkRate": 0.08, "cycleEfficiency": 0.92, "parallelizationRatio": 5.0, "cleanupCompliance": 1.0}
   }
   ```

   When the recorded proportionate-mode risk decision skips review, record `codeReview` as `{"status":"skipped","recommendation":null,"evidence":"<specific low-risk skip rationale>"}` instead. Never claim `APPROVE` without a reviewer.

## Dynamic Steering

Use steering for structured, evidence-backed mutation. Reject natural-language steering.

| Kind | When | Fields |

## IssueOps Integration

When an IssueOps cycle exists:

1. **Goal ↔ IssueOps phase**: `implement` phase → Verified Execution execution loop. `pr` phase → Verified Execution final quality gate.
2. **Evidence ↔ IssueOps state**: After each criterion PASS, record evidence in IssueOps:
   ```bash
   issueops feedback add --id "$ISSUEOPS_ID" --source verified-execution --body "G1-C1 PASS: <evidence_path> | cleanup: <receipt>" --json
   ```
3. **Progress record**: Inspect the durable generation and native process receipt with execution status. Criterion detail belongs in a concise feedback entry:
   ```bash
   issueops execution status --id "$ISSUEOPS_ID" --json
   issueops feedback add --id "$ISSUEOPS_ID" --source verified-execution --body "G1-C1 START: <scenario>" --json
   ```
4. **Owner completion**: The active generation holder writes the evidence report, creates and verifies the draft PR/MR, then records `issueops execution complete` with exact actor, cwd, generation, final HEAD, report, artifact URL, and verification evidence. Completion releases the generation but never merges or cleans up resources.
5. **Phase advancement**: After all criteria pass + quality gate clean:
   ```bash
   issueops phase --id "$ISSUEOPS_ID" --to pr --json
   ```

## Cross-Host Translation Table

| Action | Codex | Claude Code |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Run shell command | Use the current shell/terminal tool with explicit cwd | Same principle |
| Read file | Use the current file-read or shell read tool | Same principle |
| Search codebase | Prefer indexed search when configured; otherwise `rg` | Same principle |
| Write/edit files | Use the current patch/edit tool | Same principle |
| Write evidence file | Use the current patch/edit tool or CLI that owns the state | Same principle |
| State checkpoint | `issueops state write --key KEY (--value TEXT|--input FILE|--stdin) --json` | Same |
| Spawn explorer (pattern #1) | Only when the current Codex session exposes and permits sub-agents | Only when Task is available |
| Spawn reviewer (pattern #2) | Only when the current Codex session exposes and permits sub-agents | Only when Task is available |
| External docs research (pattern #3) | Use current web/docs tools or `web-research`; do not name unavailable tools as executable | Same principle |
| Background + poll (pattern #8) | Use current async/job tools only when available | Same principle |

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER** mark `criterion.status == "pass"` without captured observable evidence AND cleanup receipt.
2. **PERFORM** all code edits, test writes, fixes, and QA directly as the main agent. Sub-agents only per the 12 net-positive patterns (see Sub-Agent Usage section).
3. **BASELINE-PIN** existing behavior before changing it: characterization test FIRST.
4. **CLEANUP IS PAIRED**: no PASS without cleanup receipt. Leftover runtime state = BLOCKED.
5. **METRICS ARE TRACKED**: recompute evidence coverage, rework rate, cycle efficiency, parallelization ratio, cleanup compliance after every criterion.
6. **REVIEWER IS BINDING**: when the risk-calibrated gate requires one, spawn an adversarial reviewer (pattern #2), verify every concern, fix confirmed findings yourself, and re-submit until unconditional approval.
7. **SUB-AGENT OUTPUT IS A CLAIM**: re-verify diff, tests, LSP yourself before accepting.
8. **3x same-criterion failure** → exit the goal with diagnosis.
9. **5 cycles on one goal without all-pass** → checkpoint failed, surface diagnosis.
10. **NO SUB-AGENT NESTING**: sub-agents must not spawn further sub-agents.

## Stop Rules

- All goals complete + all criteria `pass` + final quality gate clean: **DONE**.
- 3x same criterion failure: checkpoint failed, surface diagnosis.
- 5 cycles on one goal without all-pass: checkpoint failed, surface.
- Safety boundary (destructive command, secret exfiltration, production write): block and surface a safe substitute.
- Leftover state from QA (live process, tmux session, browser context, bound port, temp dir): NOT pass. Clean up, append receipt, then continue.
- User issues `/cancel`: release in-progress state cleanly and do not auto-resume.

## Relationship with Other Skills

| Skill | How Verified Execution integrates |
|-------|----------------------|
| **implementation-planning** | Implementation Planning produces the decision-complete plan; Verified Execution executes it as evidence-bound goals. Plan TODOs map 1:1 to Verified Execution criteria. Dispatch independent read-only exploration or isolated worktree edits only when a documented net-positive pattern applies; all interdependent implementation stays in the main agent. |
| **issueops-debugging** | Debugging is called within Verified Execution's execution loop when a criterion fails 2+ times. Debugging delivers the root cause diagnosis; Verified Execution verifies the fix through channel QA. |
| **algorithm-optimization** | Verified Execution invokes Algorithm Optimization for "optimize," "reduce complexity," or "improve performance" criteria. Algorithm Optimization delivers the algorithmic redesign with benchmark evidence. |
| **database-design** | Database Design's EXPLAIN ANALYZE before/after evidence becomes Verified Execution's evidence artifact. Database Design recommends; Verified Execution verifies the recommendation through channel QA. |
| **web-research** | When a criterion requires external research, Verified Execution delegates to Web Research. Research reports are Verified Execution evidence artifacts; adversarial review of findings follows Verified Execution's reviewer gate. |
| **git-operations** | Every code change from Verified Execution's execution is committed atomically per Git Operations' protocols. Verified Execution's evidence files are committed alongside code changes. |
| **code-quality-metrics** | Code Quality Metrics's SNR/Entropy/Redundancy metrics feed into Verified Execution's Final Quality Gate as quantitative quality dimensions alongside the existing reviewer gate. |
| **self-verify** | Verified Execution's execution health is validated by self-verify loops; self-verify goal scores feed into Verified Execution's evidence coverage metric. |
| **self-augment** | Verified Execution records Reflexion-style lessons via self-augment when a criterion fails repeatedly; the lesson informs future execution strategies. |
